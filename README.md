## üöÄ Getting Started

Clone this repo and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/solid-pixel/uhf-server-docker
cd uhf-server-docker
docker compose up -d    # Will automatically pull image from Docker Hub
```

Then open UHF, go to the Recordings tab, and add:

- SERVER ADDRESS: `<your-host-ip>`
- SERVER PORT: `8000` (or the port you set up in `docker-compose.yml`)

That's it! No building required.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Customization

The following environment variables can be configured in `docker-compose.yml`:
- **API_HOST**: Bind to all interfaces (default: `0.0.0.0`)
- **API_PORT**: Default API port inside container (default: `8000`) - changing this might break healthchecks
- **RECORDINGS_DIR**: Location for recordings (default: `/var/lib/uhf-server/recordings`)
- **DB_PATH**: Path to database file (default: `/var/lib/uhf-server/db.json`)
- **LOG_LEVEL**: Logging verbosity (default: `INFO`) - (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)

You can also customize:
- **Storage location:** adjust the `volumes:` path in `docker-compose.yml`
- **Port mapping:** change `8000:8000` to `YOUR_PORT:8000` in `docker-compose.yml` to use a different external port
- **Auto-restart:** enabled via `restart: unless-stopped` in `docker-compose.yml`
- **Health checks:** container health is monitored every 30s via `/server/stats` endpoint
