> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer:** 
This Docker wrapper is _not officially developed or maintained_ by Swapplications (the creators of UHF Server).  
> I'm not affiliated with them ‚Äî I just built this to make deployment easier for the community.  
>  
> I do **not** maintain the `uhf-server` script itself ‚Äî only the Docker setup.  
> If you run into issues with the actual recording logic or the server code, you'll need to contact the UHF devs directly.  
>  
> For bugs, suggestions, or Docker-related issues, please **open an Issue or PR on GitHub**. Reddit and Discord DMs won't be monitored.

> **Note:** This README and repository are built with Docker Compose in mind. While other methods of running the container may work, they are not officially supported and are up to the user to figure out.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Clone this repo and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/solid-pixel/uhf-server-docker
cd uhf-server-docker
docker compose up -d    # Will automatically pull image from Docker Hub
```

Then open UHF, go to the Recordings tab, and add:

- SERVER ADDRESS: `<your-host-ip>`
- SERVER PORT: `8000` (or the port you set up in `docker-compose.yml`)

That's it! No building required. 

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Customization

The following environment variables can be configured in `docker-compose.yml`:
- **API_HOST**: Bind to all interfaces (default: `0.0.0.0`)
- **API_PORT**: Default API port inside container (default: `8000`) - changing this might break healthchecks
- **RECORDINGS_DIR**: Location for recordings (default: `/var/lib/uhf-server/recordings`)
- **DB_PATH**: Path to database file (default: `/var/lib/uhf-server/db.json`)
- **LOG_LEVEL**: Logging verbosity (default: `INFO`) - (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)

You can also customize:
- **Storage location:** adjust the `volumes:` path in `docker-compose.yml`
- **Port mapping:** change `8000:8000` to `YOUR_PORT:8000` in `docker-compose.yml` to use a different external port
- **Auto-restart:** enabled via `restart: unless-stopped` in `docker-compose.yml`
- **Health checks:** container health is monitored every 30s via `/server/stats` endpoint
- **Recordings folder:** override only the recordings directory by uncommenting `./uhf-recordings:/var/lib/uhf-server/recordings` in `docker-compose.yml` (optional; in addition to the main data mount)

## üñ•Ô∏è Running on Unraid and TrueNAS SCALE

If you‚Äôre not using Docker Compose, make sure to set the container‚Äôs command to `uhf-server` manually in the UI. These platforms don‚Äôt use `docker-compose.yml`, so the default entrypoint won‚Äôt be applied. Without this, the server won‚Äôt start.
